//! Lenient parser for Semantic Version numbers.
//!
//! ## Motivation
//!
//! This crate aims to provide an alternative parser for [semver `Version`s](https://crates.io/crates/semver).
//!
//! Instead of adhering to the semver specification, this parser is more lenient in what it allows.
//! The differenc include:
//!
//! - Minor and Path are optional an default to 0 (e.g. "1" parses at "1.0.0")
//! - Pre-release identifier may be separated by `.` as well (e.g. "1.2.3.rc1" parses at "1.2.3-rc1")
//! - Some pre-release identifiers are parsed as build identifier (e.g. "1.2.3.Final" parses at "1.2.3+Final")
//!
